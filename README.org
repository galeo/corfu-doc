#+AUTHOR: Yuwei Tian

*Important:* this package has been merged into Corfu as one of its [[https://github.com/minad/corfu#extensions][extensions]].
And this repository is *deprecated* now.

* Installation

Corfu-doc is available from [[https://melpa.org/#/corfu-doc][MELPA]], and can be
installed via =package-install=. You can also manually install it via
=package-install-file=.

Enable it with =M-x corfu-doc-mode= or by using =corfu-mode-hook=:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'corfu-mode-hook #'corfu-doc-mode)
#+end_src

** Scroll the documentation

Bind keys =M-p= and =M-n= to commands =corfu-doc-scroll-down= and
=corfu-doc-scroll-up= to scroll the documentation.

#+begin_src elisp
(define-key corfu-map (kbd "M-p") #'corfu-doc-scroll-down) ;; corfu-next
(define-key corfu-map (kbd "M-n") #'corfu-doc-scroll-up)  ;; corfu-previous
#+end_src

** Quickly toggle the documentation on or off

Bind a key to quickly toggle the documentation popup on or off.

#+begin_src elisp
(define-key corfu-map (kbd "M-d") #'corfu-doc-toggle)
#+end_src

** Display the doc frame beyond the parent frame

The doc frame is displayed within the parent frame by default.
However, the position of the doc frame can be calculated base on the size of
the display monitor if =corfu-doc-display-within-parent-frame= is set to =nil=.

#+begin_quote
Most window-systems clip a child frame at the native edges (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Frame-Geometry.html][Frame Geometry]])
of its parent frame—everything outside these edges
is usually invisible...

NS builds do not clip child frames at the parent frame’s edges,
allowing them to be positioned so they do not obscure the parent frame while
still being visible themselves.
#+end_quote

Please see "(elisp) Child Frames" in Emacs manual for details.
